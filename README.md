# GeniusEngine - The Forever WIP OpenGL Game Engine
GeniusEngine is a horrible C++ OpenGL game engine developed as a hobby by a not so genius developer.

### Platforms
- Linux (Ubuntu)
- Idk? It'll probably compile if you try hard enough

### Main Features
- It spawns a window!! :skull:
- It has unnecessary abstractions! :fire:
- It does 3D!!! (OpenGL is 3D by default, not that you'd know due to the engine's brilliance) :fire_engine:
